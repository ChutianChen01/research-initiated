# Literature Research Plan

## Research Question

Are cellulosome and homologous proteins widely exist in Bacteroidota? What are the functions of the homologous proteins if they are not forming cellulosome?


## Sources to Search
Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, uniprot, PDB

## Key Topics / Keywords
cellulosome, scaffold proteins

## Inclusion Criteria
From a broader view, as long as they are talking about something related to cellulosome proteins they're fine.


## Output
 - a figrue showing the trend of papers in this field
 - a phylogeny tree of the existance of cellulosome and homologous proteins in bacteroidota.
 - a spreadsheet to list top 20 most interesting proteins to investigate more under this criteria. Include basic informations about this protein like the original literacture link, links to ncbi/uniprot/pdb, notes about why they are interesting.
