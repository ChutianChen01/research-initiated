# Literature Research Plan

## Research Question

Are cellulosome and homologous proteins widely present in Bacteroidota? What are the functions of homologous proteins if they are not forming cellulosomes?

## Sources to Search
Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, UniProt, PDB

## Key Topics / Keywords
- Primary: cellulosome, scaffoldin, cohesin, dockerin, Bacteroidota, Bacteroidetes
- Secondary: polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL), CAZymes, carbohydrate-active enzymes, SusC, SusD
- Tertiary: gut microbiome polysaccharide degradation, glycoside hydrolases Bacteroidetes, outer membrane complexes Bacteroidota
- Organism-specific: Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Tannerella, Alistipes

## Inclusion Criteria
- Papers discussing cellulosome proteins, scaffoldin/cohesin/dockerin domains, or homologous proteins in Bacteroidota
- Papers on polysaccharide degradation complexes in Bacteroidota that may be functionally analogous to cellulosomes
- Structural/functional studies of CAZyme complexes in gut Bacteroidetes
- Phylogenetic or genomic surveys of cellulosome-like proteins

## Output Files
