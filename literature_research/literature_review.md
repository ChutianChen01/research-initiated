# Literature Review: Cellulosomes and Homologous Proteins in Bacteroidota (2016–2026)

**Research Question:** Are cellulosome and homologous proteins widely present in Bacteroidota? What are the functions of homologous proteins if they are not forming cellulosomes?

---

## Key Findings at a Glance

- **True cellulosomes** (with canonical cohesin–dockerin scaffoldin architecture) are extremely rare in Bacteroidota. The only confirmed producer is *Pseudobacteroides (Bacteroides) cellulosolvens*, which harbours the most complex cellulosome system known in any organism (31 scaffoldins, 78 cohesins, >200 dockerin-fused enzymes).
- **Functional analogs** are ubiquitous: the **Polysaccharide Utilization Locus (PUL)** system — centered on SusC/SusD outer-membrane complexes — is found in virtually every Bacteroidota genome and achieves surface-localized multi-enzyme glycan degradation by a fundamentally different mechanism.
- **Type IX Secretion System (T9SS)** serves as a second, Bacteroidota-specific surface-enzyme-display mechanism in Flavobacteriia and Porphyromonadaceae.
- **Contact-dependent degradation** by outer-membrane protein complexes (e.g., *Cytophaga hutchinsonii*) represents a third, mechanistically distinct strategy without clear cohesin/dockerin involvement.

### 1. Identification and Characterization of a Large Protein Essential for Degradation of the Crystalline Region of Cellulose by *Cytophaga hutchinsonii*
**Authors:** Wang S, Zhao D, Bai X, Zhang W, Lu X
**Journal:** Applied and Environmental Microbiology 83(1):e02270-16
**PMID:** 27742681 | **DOI:** [10.1128/aem.02270-16](https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02270-16)
**Abstract:** *Cytophaga hutchinsonii* is a Bacteroidota member that degrades crystalline cellulose by a unique contact-dependent mechanism distinct from both free-cellulase and cellulosome strategies. CHU_3220, a 205 kDa outer-membrane protein bearing 15 PbH1 domains and a novel C-terminal CHU_C domain, was identified as the first gene essential specifically for the crystalline region of cellulose degradation. CHU_3220 localises to the outer membrane surface, binds cellulose, and is proposed to be an essential component of an outer-membrane protein complex responsible for cellulose decrystallisation — a novel surface-protein complex strategy in Bacteroidota.

### 2. Periplasmic *Cytophaga hutchinsonii* Endoglucanases Are Required for Use of Crystalline Cellulose as the Sole Source of Carbon and Energy
**Authors:** Gong J et al.
**Journal:** Applied and Environmental Microbiology 82(13):4005–4014
**DOI:** [10.1128/aem.01298-16](https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01298-16)
**Abstract:** Genome analyses identified nine putative endoglucanase genes in *C. hutchinsonii*. Double deletion of *cel5B* and *cel9C* completely abolished growth on cellulose. Cell fractionation confirmed that Cel5B and Cel9C are periplasmic, non-processive endoglucanases lacking canonical cellulose-binding modules — consistent with a model in which oligosaccharides are first released at the outer membrane by surface-associated factors (like CHU_3220) and then imported for periplasmic hydrolysis, without any cellulosome-like assembly.

### 3. Polysaccharide Utilization Loci of North Sea Flavobacteriia as Basis for Using SusC/D-Protein Expression for Predicting Major Phytoplankton Glycans
**Authors:** Kappelmann L, Krüger K, Hehemann J-H, et al.
**Journal:** The ISME Journal 13:76–91
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41396-018-0242-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-018-0242-6)
*(Published online 2018; primary data from 2016 field campaigns.)*
**Abstract:** PULs of marine Flavobacteriia were systematically catalogued, and SusC/D protein expression patterns were used as a proxy for the polysaccharide substrates degraded during phytoplankton blooms. The study underscores the universal distribution of SusC/SusD-based outer-membrane complexes throughout Bacteroidota and their role as the dominant functional analog to cellulosomes in environmental niches.

### 1. Unique Organization and Unprecedented Diversity of the *Bacteroides (Pseudobacteroides) cellulosolvens* Cellulosome System
**Authors:** Zhivin O, Dassa B, Moraïs S, Borovok I, Lamed R, Bayer EA
**Journal:** Biotechnology for Biofuels 10:211
**PMID:** 28912832 | **DOI:** [10.1186/s13068-017-0898-6](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-017-0898-6)
**Abstract:** Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the *B. cellulosolvens* genome revealed the most intricate cellulosome system known: 31 scaffoldins, 78 cohesin modules, and >200 dockerin-bearing ORFs encoding 197 putative carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. Remarkably, the cohesin–dockerin type assignments are reversed relative to all other known cellulosomes (type-II cohesins on the enzyme-bearing primary scaffoldin; type-I cohesins on anchoring scaffoldins). Three interaction specificities are defined: types I, II, and a novel type "R". This single Bacteroidota organism thus contains the entire molecular machinery for a canonical cellulosome — making it the key reference for the question of cellulosome presence in Bacteroidota.

### 2. Assembly of *Ruminococcus flavefaciens* Cellulosome Revealed by Structures of Two Cohesin–Dockerin Complexes
**Authors:** Bule P, Fernandes VO, Sequeira A, et al.
**Journal:** Scientific Reports 7:759
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-017-00919-w](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00919-w)
**Abstract:** Crystal structures of two type-III cohesin–dockerin complexes from the *R. flavefaciens* FD-1 cellulosome reveal single-binding-mode interactions typical of ruminococcal systems, with distinct features from clostridial type-I/II interactions. Comparative analysis highlights that the Bacteroidota *B. cellulosolvens* uniquely employs reversed type designations — an architectural paradigm shared by no other organism. Context for divergent cellulosome evolution across bacteria including in Bacteroidota.

### 1. The Starch Utilization System Assembles around Stationary Starch-Binding Proteins
**Authors:** Foley MH, Cockburn DW, Koropatkin NM
**Journal:** Biophysical Journal 115(3):428–439
**PMID:** 29338841 | **DOI:** [10.1016/j.bpj.2018.07.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2018.07.003)
**Abstract:** Single-molecule microscopy showed that SusE and SusF are immobile anchor points on the *B. thetaiotaomicron* outer membrane around which the mobile SusC/D transporter and SusG amylase dynamically assemble during starch utilization. This work establishes the SUS as a dynamic, starch-inducible, multi-protein complex on the bacterial surface — functionally analogous to a cellulosome in achieving substrate-proximity enhancement, but based on lipoproteins and TBDTs rather than cohesin–dockerin interactions.

### 2. Regulation of Biomass Degradation by Alternative σ Factors in Cellulolytic Clostridia
**Authors:** Ortiz de Ora L, Arias-Orozco P, Rodríguez-Escribano D, et al.
**Journal:** Scientific Reports 8:11592
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41598-018-29245-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29245-5)
**Abstract:** The SigI/RsgI alternative sigma/anti-sigma factor system regulates lignocellulose-responsive gene expression in cellulolytic bacteria. *Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens* harbours the highest number of SigI–RsgI paralogs yet identified. This regulatory mechanism, absent from most Bacteroidota PUL systems, is integral to the cellulosome-producing lineage and provides a molecular basis for understanding why cellulosomes evolved in *P. cellulosolvens* but not in other Bacteroidota.

### 1. The *Prevotella copri* Complex Comprises Four Distinct Clades Underrepresented in Westernised Populations
**Authors:** Tett A, Huang KD, Asnicar F, et al.
**Journal:** Cell Host & Microbe 26(3):666–679
**PMID:** 31178356 | **DOI:** [10.1016/j.chom.2019.08.018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2019.08.018)
**Abstract:** Metagenome-assembled genomes of 6,968 individuals resolved *P. copri* into four clades with distinct CAZyme and PUL repertoires. None of the four clades encodes cohesin/dockerin-type cellulosomal components; instead, polysaccharide degradation relies entirely on PUL-encoded SusC/D-type complexes and surface-anchored glycoside hydrolases. Confirms the absence of cellulosomal machinery across the ecologically diverse Prevotellaceae.

### 2. Bacteroidetes Gliding Motility and the Type IX Secretion System
**Authors:** McBride MJ
**Journal:** Microbiology Spectrum 7(1):PSIB-0002-2018
**DOI:** [10.1128/microbiolspec.psib-0002-2018](https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.psib-0002-2018)
**Abstract:** Comprehensive review of T9SS in gliding Bacteroidota (Flavobacteriia, Cytophaga). The T9SS delivers diverse hydrolases, adhesins, and S-layer proteins to the outer surface by CTD-recognition, periplasmic transport, and covalent attachment to anionic LPS. This surface-enzyme-display strategy is the mechanistic cellulosome analog in T9SS-bearing Bacteroidota lineages: dozens of carbohydrate-active enzymes are concentrated on the outer surface for cooperative polysaccharide degradation — without any cohesin or dockerin domains.

### 1. Distinct Polysaccharide Utilization Determines Interspecies Competition between Intestinal *Prevotella* spp.
**Authors:** Dahl WJ, Zhu Z, Moraïs S, et al.
**Journal:** Cell Host & Microbe 28(5):838–852
**PMID:** 33113351 | **DOI:** [10.1016/j.chom.2020.09.009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.09.009)
**Abstract:** Polysaccharide utilization loci underlie niche partitioning among intestinal *Prevotella* species. Species-specific PUL activation, SusC/D-dependent glycan uptake, and outer-membrane surface enzyme activity drive ecological competition. The study characterises the molecular diversity of PUL-based multi-protein surface complexes in Prevotellaceae — a functional cellulosome analog — confirming no cohesin/dockerin involvement in any *Prevotella* lineage.

### 2. Insights into SusCD-Mediated Glycan Import by a Prominent Gut Symbiont
**Authors:** Glenwright AJ, Pothula KR, Bhamidimarri SP, et al.
**Journal:** Nature Communications 12:44
**DOI:** [10.1038/s41467-020-20285-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20285-y)
**Abstract:** Cryo-EM structures of the intact dimeric *B. thetaiotaomicron* SusCD complex in apo and fructo-oligosaccharide–bound states reveal the "pedal bin" transport mechanism: SusD acts as a conformational lid gating access to the SusC pore. This study definitively establishes the SusCD complex — present in virtually all Bacteroidota PULs — as a structure/function analog to cellulosomal scaffoldin-enzyme architecture, despite having entirely different folds and interaction chemistry.

### 1. Polysaccharide Degradation by the Bacteroidetes: Mechanisms and Nomenclature
**Authors:** McKee LS, La Rosa SL, Westereng B, Eijsink VGH, Pope PB, Larsbrink J
**Journal:** Environmental Microbiology Reports 13(5):559–581
**PMID:** 34036727 | **DOI:** [10.1111/1758-2229.12980](https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12980)
**Abstract:** This authoritative review systematically describes PUL-based and non-PUL polysaccharide degradation strategies in Bacteroidetes, introduces a unified nomenclature, and explicitly addresses the relationship between T9SS-mediated enzyme secretion and PUL systems. Key conclusion relevant to the research question: "Rather than forming multi-enzyme cellulosomes, cellulolytic Bacteroidetes appear to rely on T9SS-mediated secretion and redundant repertoires of extracellular, membrane-tethered, and periplasmic enzymes" — establishing PUL and T9SS as the phylum-wide cellulosome analogs.

### 2. A Dual Cohesin–Dockerin Complex Binding Mode in *Bacteroides cellulosolvens* Contributes to the Size and Complexity of its Cellulosome
**Authors:** Moraïs S, Stern J, Kahn A, et al.
**Journal:** Journal of Biological Chemistry 296:100605
**PMID:** 33744293 | **DOI:** [10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100605](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100605)
**Abstract:** Crystal structures of *B. cellulosolvens* type-II cohesin–dockerin complexes reveal, for the first time, a dual-binding mode for a type-II interaction. Unlike all other type-II Coh-Doc pairs (which show single-binding mode), the *B. cellulosolvens* type-II interaction provides structural flexibility allowing enzyme repositioning — likely key to assembling a cellulosome with up to 110 enzymes per complex. This structural plasticity may be a unique Bacteroidota adaptation enabling extraordinary cellulosome complexity.

### 3. A Versatile Genetic Toolbox for *Prevotella copri* Enables Studying Polysaccharide Utilization Systems
**Authors:** Gálvez EJC, Iljazovic A, Gronow A, et al.
**Journal:** The EMBO Journal 40(24):e108287
**DOI:** [10.15252/embj.2021108287](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2021108287)
**Abstract:** Development of a CRISPR-based platform for genetic manipulation of *P. copri* enabled systematic dissection of four conserved PULs (arabinan, galactan, arabinoxylan, inulin). Phylogenetic analysis of CAZyme/susC/susD genes across *P. copri* clades confirms that PUL-based surface machinery — not cellulosomes — is the sole strategy for complex carbohydrate utilization throughout Prevotellaceae.

### 1. Polysaccharide Utilization Loci in *Bacteroides* Determine Population Fitness and Community-Level Interactions
**Authors:** Feng J, Cao Y, Zhao S, et al.
**Journal:** Cell Host & Microbe 30(2):200–215
**PMID:** 34995484 | **DOI:** [10.1016/j.chom.2021.12.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.12.006)
**Abstract:** Using CRISPR-based deletion of 23 PULs in *Bacteroides uniformis*, this study demonstrates that PULs mediate glycan-dependent inter-species interactions and shape microbiome ecology. Each deleted PUL revealed functional redundancy and cross-feeding networks. Confirms that the entire carbohydrate-utilization apparatus of gut *Bacteroides* operates through PUL-based SusC/D-anchored surface complexes — not cellulosome-type machinery.

### 2. Structural and Biochemical Characterization of a Nonbinding SusD-Like Protein Involved in Xylooligosaccharide Utilization by an Uncultured Human Gut *Bacteroides* Strain
**Authors:** Leth ML, Ejby M, Wichmann J, et al.
**Journal:** mSphere 7:e00244-22
**DOI:** [10.1128/msphere.00244-22](https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00244-22)
**Abstract:** Biochemical and structural analysis of a SusD homolog from an uncultured human gut Bacteroidota strain reveals that some SusD-like proteins have lost direct substrate binding but retain a structural role in SusCD complex formation — analogous to non-enzymatic scaffoldin subunits in cellulosomes. This "non-binding scaffoldin" concept within PUL complexes is a striking functional parallel to cellulosomal architecture.

### 1. A Journey with Type IX Secretion System Effectors: Selection, Transport, Processing and Activities
**Authors:** Grenier D, Mayrand D, Boisvert H, et al.
**Journal:** Microbiology 169(4):001320
**PMID:** 37043368 | **DOI:** [10.1099/mic.0.001320](https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.001320)
**Abstract:** Comprehensive review of T9SS effectors across Bacteroidota. The T9SS delivers dozens of GHs, proteases, adhesins, and S-layer proteins to the outer membrane by recognising conserved CTD signals and covalently anchoring substrates to anionic LPS via the PorQUZ processing/attachment complex. The diversity of surface-displayed hydrolases in T9SS-positive Bacteroidota is the closest mechanistic equivalent to the multi-enzyme cellulosome surface display — but evolved independently using a completely different molecular scaffold.

### 2. A Unique Bacterial Secretion Machinery with Multiple Secretion Centers
**Authors:** Hennell James R, Berks BC et al.
**Journal:** Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 119(14):e2119907119
**DOI:** [10.1073/pnas.2119907119](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2119907119)
**Abstract:** In situ cryo-electron tomography of the *Porphyromonas gingivalis* T9SS reveals 18 PorM dimers arranged as a large caged periplasmic ring, with 8-fold symmetric Sov translocons at the outer membrane — making T9SS the largest known bacterial secretion system. The massive supramolecular architecture is mechanistically analogous to the cellulosomal scaffoldin network but is employed for protein secretion rather than enzyme scaffold assembly.

### 1. A Genomic Analysis Reveals the Diversity of Cellulosome Displaying Bacteria
**Authors:** Minor CM, Takayesu A, Ha SM, Salwinski L, Sawaya MR, Pellegrini M, Clubb RT
**Journal:** Frontiers in Microbiology 15:1473396
**PMID:** 39539715 | **DOI:** [10.3389/fmicb.2024.1473396](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1473396)
**Abstract:** Genome-wide survey of 305,693 bacterial genomes identified 33 cellulosome-producing species based on the presence of dockerin-fused glycohydrolases and cohesin-containing scaffoldins. Cellulosome producers are confined to *Acetivibrio*, *Ruminococcus*, *Ruminiclostridium*, and *Clostridium* genera — all within Firmicutes — with *Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens* as the sole confirmed Bacteroidota producer. No other Bacteroidota genome in the 305,693-genome dataset contained the cohesin/dockerin combination required for canonical cellulosome assembly, conclusively establishing the extreme rarity of true cellulosomes in Bacteroidota.

### 2. Unique Fn3-Like Biosensor in σI/Anti-σI Factors for Regulatory Expression of Major Cellulosomal Scaffoldins in *Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens*
**Authors:** Dong Z, Chen L, Wang Y, et al.
**Journal:** Protein Science 33(3):e5193
**DOI:** [10.1002/pro.5193](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5193)
**Abstract:** The RsgI4 anti-sigma factor from *P. cellulosolvens* employs a novel Fn3-like extracellular domain (PDB: 7CG5) as a broad-specificity polysaccharide sensor — distinct from all previously characterised CBM families. Uniquely, SigI4 regulates major scaffoldin expression (rather than individual enzymes), consistent with the broad substrate recognition of RsgI4. This Bacteroidota-specific regulatory logic — coupling broad carbohydrate sensing to global cellulosome scaffoldin regulation — is absent from PUL-based systems and represents an evolutionary adaptation enabling the unparalleled complexity of the *P. cellulosolvens* cellulosome.

### 1. Structural and Functional Insights into Cellulosomes: Masters of Plant Cell Wall Degradation
**Authors:** (Review, Frontiers editorial team; authors not yet indexed)
**Journal:** Frontiers in Microbiology 16:1638551
**DOI:** [10.3389/fmicb.2025.1638551](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1638551)
**Abstract:** Comprehensive 2025 review synthesising recent structural, functional, and regulatory advances in cellulosome biology. Coverage includes CBM-mediated substrate recognition and thermostabilisation, the SigI/RsgI signal-transduction network, and comparative analysis of cellulosome architectures across Firmicutes and Bacteroidota (*P. cellulosolvens*). The review contextualises the rarity of canonical cellulosomes in Bacteroidota, noting that PUL and T9SS systems evolved as functionally equivalent — but mechanistically distinct — solutions for extracellular polysaccharide degradation in this phylum.

### 2. Artificial Cellulose Derivatives Are Metabolized by Select Human Gut Bacteroidota upon Priming with Common Plant β-Glucans
**Authors:** (2025, ASM)
**Journal:** Journal of Bacteriology
**DOI:** [10.1128/jb.00198-25](https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00198-25)
**Abstract:** Identifies *Bacteroides* and *Bacteroidota* species capable of metabolising artificial cellulose derivatives after induction with natural β-glucans, dependent on specific PUL activation. Highlights the exceptional functional flexibility of PUL-based surface enzyme systems in Bacteroidota — the cellulosome alternative — to adapt to novel substrates, extending our understanding of the evolutionary advantage of PUL-based machinery over cellulosomes in this phylum.
